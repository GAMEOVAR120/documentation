# Getting started with MCSS


## Introduction {#-introduction}


MC Server Soft (aka MCSS) is a free software designed to help you run Minecraft servers on your computer.

It is not a hosting company like Aternos - the servers run on your computer.

It is maintained since 2011 by [Fireblade](https://github.com/fiahblade).
