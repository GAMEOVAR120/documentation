Since Minecraft version 1.17, both client and server need Java 16 or above to run. 

if your 1.17 server does not start and / or gives you odd Java related errors, please [download java 16+](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot) and follow [this guide](../guides/java-path-update.md) to use it !
