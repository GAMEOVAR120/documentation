## MCSS and Minecraft are on the same computer {#-mcss-and-minecraft-are-on-the-same-computer}

Try connecting to your server using `localhost` instead of your IP. If that works it means your server is online, great ! Now you just need to port forward for your friends to join.

## MCSS and Minecraft are on separate computer inside my house {#-mcss-and-minecraft-are-on-separate-computer-inside-my-house}

Try connecting using your server's local IP. 
Finding it is pretty easy, open a command prompt by typing `cmd` in Windows' search bar, then type 

```cmd
ipconfig | findstr IPv4
```
