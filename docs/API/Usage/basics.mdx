## Making API calls

In order to make API calls you need special software. 


### Standalone softwares

Standalone softwares allow you to make API calls from a nice interface. These softwares support everything you need, from simple HTTP requests to advanced features like authentication.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="postman" label="Postman">Free forever, with unlimited calls and APIs. You can add up to three people to your team to share your work with them.
    You can download postman <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">here</a>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="insomnia" label="Insomnia">Free forever, with unlimited calls and APIs. you can share your work with as many people as you want.</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### VSC extensions

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="rest client" label="Rest Client">This is an apple üçé</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="thunder client" label="Thunder Client">This is an orange üçä</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<!-- 
<p>If you a standalone software, you can use <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a> or <a href="https://insomnia.rest/download">Insomnia</a>. Both are free and essentially do the same thing. </p>
<p>There are extensions for Visual Studio Code that can be used to make API calls, such as <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client">Rest Client</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client">Thunder Client</a>.</p>
