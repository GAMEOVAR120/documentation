Since version 12, MCSS supports an API that allows you to interact with your servers remotely.

It is currently in it's first iteration, but is a work in progress.

If you have any feature requests for the API, feel free to send them over on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DEn89PB).

## What does it do

The API allows you to control MCSS remotely. As of right now the API can : 

* Run power actions - Start, Stop, Restart or Kill your servers

* Send commands - run minecraft commands in the console

* Return server information like the icon and status


## Enabling it

For your safety and to preserve resources, the API is disabled by default. To enable it, open the settings `file > options` and scroll all the way down.

You will see a tick box labeled `Enable Web API`. Tick it. Below you will see a button labeled `Manage Users`. From the new window you will be able to create and delete users. Create a new user, then close the software to apply all the changes. 

When you restart MCSS, the API will be enabled !
