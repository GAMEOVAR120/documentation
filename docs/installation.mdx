## Downloading MCSS

If you have all the pre-requisites installed, you can now install MCSS itself. 

To do so, you need to [download the latest release](https://mcserversoft.com/downloadlatest). This will download a `.zip` file. 

You need to extract the files to your computer. We recommend you extract them to a MCSS folder on the desktop for easy access.

Now double click `mcss.exe` and **congratulations!** You have installed MCSS.
