Once the download is done, open the file `forge-<version_minecraft>-<version_forge>-installer.jar` to begin the Forge server installation. <br>
Choose 'install server" and select an empty folder in which the server wil temporarily be installed (it will then be oved to the MCSS folder) and click OK. All the required files will be downloaded and placed in the selected folder.

*   A file `<version_minecraft>.json`
*   A file `forge-<version_minecraft>-<version_forge>.jar`

## Migrate the server to MCSS

Now, open MCSS and go to "File > migrate server. A new windows will open. Inside it, choose a name for you server and a folder name (that will be stored to `mcss/servers/<folder_name>`. Choose the amout of RAM that will be allocated to the server, in MB (it's recommended to have at least 4GB for a Forge server).<br>
In "server type" choose Forge. Finally, select the executable jar file of the server : it's the `forge-<version_minecraft>-<version_forge>.jar` file of the server you created in the steps above and click "Migrate". <br>
All the server files are copied to the /servers folder of MCSS and your server will appear in the servers list. <br>

You can also delete the temporary folder where you installed Forge, it is useless since all the files have been copied to the /servers folder of the app.

this time, it will fully start and you will b eable to connect from you Minecraft client.
