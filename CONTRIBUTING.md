Anyone can add to the documentation. If you want to edit a page, you can do so by clicking "Edit this page" at the bottom of each page. This will take you to GitHub, and from there you will be able to make your changes and create a pull request.

If you want to add a new page, fork the repository and make your changes in the "docs" folder. Then, create a pull request.
